    <description>Welcome to The Binding of Isaac: Apostasy. This mod sprouted from the minds of two morons who thought they were capable of creating the next TBOI DLC but in mod form. With no sprite work, animation, coding, or being sane experience, we set off on an adventure where we got stuck over and over again, not knowing why things weren't working or were. At some point, we figured out what we were doing, and now we are here with a mostly working mod in progress. We have made leaps and bounds and still have a loooooong way to go. Have fun, don't skill-issue, and keep in mind that everything is subject to change, and most things are not finished. Please let us know if there is anything you would change or could be balanced better, and we will keep it in mind.</description>
